# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-04)

**Core value:** IT staff plugs in, runs the tool, and instantly knows what they're looking at — device type, location, department, software status, and any gaps — no manual lookup required.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — System Collectors

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (System Collectors)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Phase 1 verified complete — Phase 2 not yet planned
Last activity: 2026-05-04 — Phase 1 verified (5/5 must-haves passed, COLL-01 + OUT-03 complete)

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~1 min
- Total execution time: ~2 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4 | ~4 min | ~1 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~1 min), 01-02 (~1 min), 01-03 (~1 min), 01-04 (~5 min)
- Trend: —

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: PyInstaller --onedir chosen (--onefile quarantined by CrowdStrike Falcon)
- Init: Win32_Product WMI class explicitly prohibited (MSI reconfiguration side effect)
- Init: Output path derived from sys.executable, not os.getcwd()
- Init: winreg used exclusively for app detection (all four Uninstall key paths)
- 01-02: station: int | None (not str) per ROADMAP SC1
- 01-02: department field name (not dept_code) per ROADMAP SC1 and D-02
- 01-02: parsed_hostname on AuditReport (not parsed_name) per ROADMAP SC1
- 01-02: No frozen=True — Phase 2 collectors populate fields after construction
- 01-03: P3_CODES check first in disambiguation chain (before seg3.isdigit) — Pitfall 1 guard
- 01-03: station stored as int(seg3) — Pitfall 2 guard
- 01-03: KUL/HKG excluded from CITY_CODES — unconfirmed for this convention

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Hostname naming convention must be validated against real production hostnames (including international offices: AMM, AMS, KUL, HKG) before parser is finalized — confirm with IT/Edgar
- Phase 4: MERP registry path is unknown — must be confirmed with IT before APP-03 detection can be completed
- Phase 5: CrowdStrike --onedir tenant policy behavior must be tested on an enrolled machine at the start of Phase 5; code-signing budget decision needed if blocked
